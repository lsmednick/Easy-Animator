Submit any files created in this assignment, along with a text README file explaining your design. 
Your README file should give the graders an overview of what the purposes are for every class, interface, etc. 
that you include in your model, so that they can quickly get a high-level overview of your code. It does not replace 
the need for proper Javadoc!
